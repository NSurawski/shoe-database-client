## Project

I am going to make a website for a shoe database for shoe collectors. Users can create a profile and add shoes to their collection. Users will be able to add, update and delete different shoe entries. Users will be able to access their entire personal show library

## User Stories

```md
1. As a user, I should be able to sign-up
2. As a user, I should be able to sign-in after sign up.
3. As a user, I should be able to change my password after signing in.
3. As a user, I should be able to create a new shoe entry when logged in.
4. As a user, I should be able to get all shoes in my library when logged in.
5. As a user, I should be able to edit specific shoe entries when I am logged in.
6. As a user, I should be able to delete a specific shoe when I am logged in.
7. As a user, I should be able to sign-out when I am finished.
```

## Planning and Process

I started this project by creating my wireframe and writing User stories based on the actions I wanted the user to be able to do to their library. I decided what information would be important for the user to have for each shoe when creating my schema, so for the client-facing portion, I mirrored that information wxactly.
