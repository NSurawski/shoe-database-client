## Project

I am going to make a website for  users to create their own shoe library for shoe collectors. Users can sign up, create a profile and add shoes to their collection. Users will be able to add, update and delete different shoe entries. Users will be able to access their entire personal shoe library.

## User Stories

```md
1. As a user, I should be able to sign-up
2. As a user, I should be able to sign-in after sign up.
3. As a user, I should be able to change my password after signing in.
3. As a user, I should be able to create a new shoe entry when logged in.
4. As a user, I should be able to get all shoes in my library when logged in.
5. As a user, I should be able to edit specific shoe entries when I am logged in.
6. As a user, I should be able to delete a specific shoe when I am logged in.
7. As a user, I should be able to sign-out when I am finished.
```

## Planning and Process

1/7

I started this project by creating my wireframe and writing User stories based on the actions I wanted the user to be able to do to their library. I decided what information would be important for the user to have for each shoe when creating my schema, so for the client-facing portion, I mirrored that information wxactly. After creating my initial templates and adding files, I added some basic HTML forms to my site in order to test my CRUD actions from the browser. I then got my CURL scripts for my authentication working. This did not take me very long, since I felt a bit more comfortable with this step after the first project.

1/8-1/11

I spent a majority of my project time working on my CRUD actions. I was able to get both "create" and "index" working perfectly, I was even able to get the customers shoes list to show up on the browser. This is where i spent a majority of my last few days working on this project. When I got stuck on an issue, I took a break and moved on to styling. I am very close to getting my update to work, I know where in my code the issue is coming from but I have not figured it out yet. I commented out the buttons for update and delete that were not working, so I didnt have buttons on my page that were not functional.

## Unsolved Problems

1. Update a single resource
2. Delete a single resource

As of 1/16 i have solved both the update and delete issue for my app.
